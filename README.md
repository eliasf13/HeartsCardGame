# HeartsCardGame

I collaborated on this project as part of a two-person team, where we were responsible for developing converters, integrating the game logic and flow, 
and implementing both local and network gameplay modes for up to four players. 
In addition, we created a custom AI client and fully integrated it into the game, ensuring smooth interaction with human players.
